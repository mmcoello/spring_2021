# Geog 288CJ Plotting Subdirectory

This repository contains the following codes written by Merissa Coello, created in GEOG 288CJ to perform analysis and plotting required for the Merissa's independent class project.

| code     | analysis  |  
|---|---|
| cross_section_plotting.ipynb   | plots north-south cross section (latitude vs height) discecting focus mountain ranges plotting atmospheric relative humidity, meridional velocity, and vertical velocity  |   
| profiler_data_v_wrf.ipynb      | compares/plots wind profiler data and wrf model outputs through time vs height plots  |  
| radiosonde_time_profiles.ipynb | compares/plots radiosonde data and wrf model outputs through time vs height plots and statistical analysis  | 
| station_data_v_wrf.ipynb       | compares/plots station observation data and wrf model outputs using various plotting techniques and statistical analysis |
| surface_wind_temp.ipynb        | plots surface wind and temperature spatial variations in maps  |
| topography_inset_map.ipynb     | plots topography of regional surrounding focus mountains  |
